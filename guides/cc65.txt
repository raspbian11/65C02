once downloaded extract the zip file
preferably, move the extracted file out of the downloads folder

open the bin folder in the unzipped files
find the program you want to use for the system (im using cc65, so does ben eater)


open powershell as admin 

replace C:\65c02\cc65-snapshot-win64\bin with ur BIN directory (KEEPS QUOTES!!!)
then run it

$bin = "C:\65c02\cc65-snapshot-win64\bin"

$path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") -split ';'
if ($path -notcontains $bin) {
  $path += $bin
}

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", ($path -join ';'), "Machine")


CLOSE ALL INSTANCES OF POWERSHELL
open it again 
run cc65 --version

u should get something like  cc65 V2.19 - Git 034f73a   

 
if it dosent work serch for "edit system environmental variables"
run it
bottom right there should be a button that says "environmental variables..."
click it

under system variables, click new
in variable name type cc65
in variable value paste the BIN directory from earlier 

click ok

click ok

click ok

CLOSE ALL INSTANCES OF POWERSHELL
open it again 
run cc65 --version

u should get something like  cc65 V2.19 - Git 034f73a   

to use just type cc65 followed by any arguments u want to make

the cc65 is to complie form c

ca65 is to compile ASM
